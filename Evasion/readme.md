## TL;DR

Sometimes we want to use tools or code snippets that help us search for sensitive data in a system, escalate privileges, move laterally, or obtain a shell. However, antivirus softwares often prevents this. We can use ready-made tools to bypass these, but they are often detected by antivirus softwares. To evade detection, we may need to modify these tools ourselves or rewrite similar tools.
